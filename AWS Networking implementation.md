#### What is an Amazon VPC?

An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is like your own private section of the Amazon cloud, where you can place and manage your resources (like servers or databases). You control who and what can go in and out, just like a gated community.

**The essential steps to creating a VPC and configuring core network services. The topics to be covered are:**

+ The Default VPC
  
+ Creating a new VPC
  
+ Creating and configuring subnets
  
#### The Default VPC

The Default VPC is like a starter pack provided by Amazon for your cloud resources. It's a pre-configured space in the Amazon cloud where you can immediately start deploying your applications or services. It has built-in security and network settings to help you get up and running quickly, but you can adjust these as you see fit.
