## DOCUMENTATION FOR SHELL SCRIPTING (HANDS ON) PROJECT

This project shows to write shell scripts. It covers essential aspects of Shell Scripting from basic commands to advanced automation and it enables us learn how to streamline tasks and boost productivity.

### <br>Introduction to Shell Scripting and User Inputs<br/>

A [Shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) is a collection of commands and instructions that are executed sequentially in a shell. Essentially, shell scripting helps us automate repetitive tasks. For instance, rather than type the **`git clone`** command 1000 times to clone 1000 repositories, we can simply write a script that does this job and then we can call the script whenever we want to perform the task. Shell scripts are created by saving a series of commands in a text file with **.sh** extension. These scripts can then be executed directly from the command line or called from another script.
