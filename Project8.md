## DOCUMENTATION FOR AUTOMATING LOAD BALANCER CONFIGURATION WITH SHELL SCRIPTING

This project demonstrates how to use shell scripting to automate the set up and maintenance of a load balancer to effectively enhance efficiency and reduce manual effort to the barest minimum.

### Introduction to Automating Load Balancer Configuration with Shell Scripting

Load balancing refers to the method of efficiently distributing network traffic equally across a pool of resources i.e a group of back end servers that support an application. Modern applications must process millions of users simultaneously and return the correct text, videos, images, and other data to each user in a fast and reliable manner.

A [Shell Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) is a collection of commands and instructions that are executed sequentially in a shell. Essentially, shell scripting helps us automate repetitive tasks.

In this project, we will be automating the entire process of deploying two back end webservers with a load balancer distributing traffic across both servers. We will do this by implementing a shell script that will
