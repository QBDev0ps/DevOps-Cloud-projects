## DOCUMENTATION FOR DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION

In the [previous project](https://github.com/QBDev0ps/DevOps-Cloud-projects/blob/main/Project9.md), we implemented a WordPress solution that is ready to be filled with content and can be used as a blog or a fully fledged website. Subsequently, in this project, we will be adding some more value to our solutions by implementing a comprehensive DevOps tooling website solution that will integrate various tools and technologies to create a unified platform that enhances collaboration, automation and efficiency for software development and operations teams.
