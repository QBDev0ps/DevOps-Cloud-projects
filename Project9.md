## DOCUMENTATION FOR IMPLEMENTING WORDPRESS WEBSITE WITH LVM STORAGE MANAGEMENT

This project demonstrates how to build and manage a scalable WordPress website using AWS EC2 and LVM (Logical Volume Management) storage. The project will delve into the intricacies of LVM storage management on Ubuntu such as the processes of creating logical volumes, managing disk space and accomodating changing storage requirements. And it will also cover performance optimization techniques and best practices for managing and securing WordPress installation in the AWS cloud.

### <br>Introduction to Implementing WordPress Website with LVM Storage Management<br/>

This project consists of two parts:

1. Configure storage infastructure on two Linux OS based (Web and Database) servers.
   
2. Deploy the Web and Database tiers of a basic web solution by installing WordPress and connecting it to a remote MySQL database server.

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in **PHP** and paired with **MySQL** or **MariaDB** as its backend Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

In terms of deploying tiers of a web solution, the **Three-tier Architecture** is generally used when implementing a web or mobile solution.

The **Three-tier Architecture** is a client-server architecture pattern that consists of three seperate layers.
